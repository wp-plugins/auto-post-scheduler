This plugin will perform 'auto post checks', triggered at set time intervals to either publish drafts or recycle old posts as new.


== Description ==

Auto Post Scheduler will schedule drafts to publish automatically and/or recycle old posts as new ones! No need to schedule draft times individually, and recycling old posts keeps your site looking fresh. 

Especially useful when importing a large number of posts, you can import them
as drafts and have the Auto Post Scheduler publish them at whatever schedule you choose.


== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through WordPress admin or upload the `Auto Post
Scheduler` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit `Settings -> Auto Post Scheduler` to set options and Enable the scheduler.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't the auto post checks trigger? Nothing is happening. =

1. Auto Post Scheduler hooks into the WordPress cron for scheduling. These
cron events are only checked when a visitor loads any page on your WordPress
site. If there are no visitors, there can be no cron checks and therefore no
auto post checks.

2. If you are using .htaccess to allow,deny by IP, make sure to allow the IP
of your WordPress site itself as the wp-cron uses that IP address.
